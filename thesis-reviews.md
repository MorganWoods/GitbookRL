1. Graph signal processing area and it's practical applications such as compression and image denoising. This thesis applys RL theory to aforementioned problem. He propose two RL based sampling algorithms.
2. Abbreviations: GSP: graph signal processing   SLP:sparse label propagation    LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator    TV: total variation    SBM: stochastic block model     RWS: random walk sampling     URS: uniform random sampling
3. **contents**:  C1: Intro  C2: ML for GSP    C3: RL fundamentals   C4: Graph signal sampling as RL problem   C5: experiments   C6:discussion   C7:conclusions
4. The nodes of graph: network elements; edges: the connections of elements; 1st challenge: representative samples selection; 2nd challenge: how to recover the required info. _**Goal**: Learn a sampling policy choosing signal samples with small reconstruction error_.
5. Upper confidence bound approach 可以更好的替代 贪婪算法; 他能衡量准确度.
6. 看到了4.2章. 先看别的.
