## Logistic regression

It is a classification model easy to implement but performs very well on linearly separable classes. For binary classification and it can be extended to multiclass classification via OvR technique.

odds ratio = p/\(1-p\) , p stands for the probability of the positive event.

logit function: logit=log{odds ratio} 

The logit function takes input values in the range 0 to 1 and transforms them to values over the entire real number range, which we can use to express a linear relationship between feature values and the log-odds
