## Basic Notation

**Tensor** - A tensor is often thought of as a generalized matrix. That is, it could be a 1-D matrix \(a vector is actually such a tensor\), a 3-D matrix \(something like a cube of numbers\), even a 0-D matrix \(a single number\), or a higher dimensional structure that is harder to visualize. The dimension of the tensor is called its **rank**.

**Identity matrix** - In linear algebra, the **identity matrix**, or sometimes ambiguously called a unit **matrix**, of size n is the n Ã— n square **matrix** with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. 

**Standard basis vector** - $$e^{(i)} = [0,...,0,1,0,...,0]$$ 

**Diagonal matrix** with diagonal entries given by a \(vector\) - diag\(a\)

**pseudoinverse** of matrix A - $$A^{+}$$ 

**Determinant** - a quantity obtained by the addition of products of the elements of a square matrix according to a given rule.

$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$ - Derivative of y w.r.t. x

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$ - Partial derivative of y w.r.t. x

$$\nabla_{x}y$$ - Gradient of y w.r.t x
